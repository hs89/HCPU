HCPU Assembler

For part 3 of this assignment (the two paper responses) see:
"Docs/Stretch.docx"
and
"Docs/System360.docx"

Part 4 (the fun stuff):

*Before getting into the details of the assembler I would like to note changes made to HCPU:
    1.  Several bugs have been found in the first version of HCPU and those bugs have been
        repaired. As a result there is much better handling of data dependence and appropriate
        stalling of the pipeline.
    2.  New command line interface commands have been added:
        a. pdm - print data memory
        b. ni <number> - clock <number> machine cycles
    3.  Code file to assemble/run can be specified on the command line (see instructions below for
        recreating loop results or assembler readme file for more details)

For the user manual of the assembler see:
"!!ASSEMBLER README.txt"
    *The user manual (readme) is fairly detailed about the syntax I have required/allowed for assembly code.

Simulation results of loops (rolled and unrolled):
*NOTE: I initialize all array elements to 0x05 prior to execution of the loop (easily seen in .asm files)

For c code of loop versions see file:
"Docs/Loop Versions.txt"

For assembly code see files:
"Assembly/loop.asm"
"Assembly/loop_unrolled.asm"

For machine code generated based on loop assembly files see:
"MachineCode/LOOP_MACHINE_CODE"
"MachineCode/LOOP_UNROLLED_MACHINE_CODE"

For tabulation and graphing of results from rolled and unrolled code see:
"Docs/LoopUnrollingResults.xlsx"

Instructions to replicate results of rolled and unrolled simulations:

1. Open command prompt and change current directory to the HCPU folder
2. Start HCPU with command line option Assembly/loop.asm
    a. C:\HCPU> HCPU.exe Assembly/loop.asm
    b. C:\HCPU> HCPU.exe Assembly/loop_unrolled.asm
3. After HCPU assembles the loop.asm and drops you at the prompt, press "c" to
   run the simulator until the end of the program and view desired metrics
4. Repeat steps 2-3 for the file "Assembly/loop_unrolled.asm" (shown in 2.b)
5. Feel free to type command "pdm" before/after execution to view the contents of the data memory

Enjoy!
