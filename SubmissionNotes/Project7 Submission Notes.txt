Paper response can be found in:
"Docs/surveyofmulticoreresponse.pdf"

I have included a zip of the code and data memory used for the benchmarking results
The zip can be found under the name "StatAssembly.rar"

I have been able to implement SIMD to the desired specification. The pneumonics for the
assembler are SIMDA, SIMDS, SIMDR

For the SIMDRotate instruction data set rotation is performed on both R0 and R1, with
status bits being saved into R2 and R3. Those status bits only indicate the Z flag because
no other flag is valid for the SIMDR instruction. That said, R2 will hold status bits 0000ZZZZ for
the rotate done on R0 where the most significant Z indicates a zero in data set 3 and the least
significant indicates a zero in data set 0. R3 holds the status bits for the rotate done on R1.

SIMDA -
R0 = R0 + R1 broken into data sets
Status flags exist in R2 and R3 after the instruction is completed
Status flags are organized in CNZV order with
R3 = CNZVCNZV for DS1DS0 respectively
R2 = CNZVCNZV for DS3DS2 respectively

SIMDS -
R0 = R0 - R1 broken into data sets
Status flags exist in R2 and R3 after the instruction is completed
Status flags are organized in CNZV the same way as with SIMDA

Statistics have been gathered for 16,36,and 64 element loops. The code for these loops
can be found in the StatAssembly.rar file under the names "16loopsimdadd.asm","16loopsimdsub.asm", etc.
The statistics gathered can be found in "Docs/SIMD-Stats.xlsx" - the first sheet is results gathered, the second
sheet organizes the results into the desired bar graphs.

If you would like to test the SIMD instructions for yourself run:
"HCPU.exe Testcode/SIMDA.asm"
"HCPU.exe Testcode/SIMDS.asm"
"HCPU.exe Testcode/SIMDR.asm"
Code in those files is just loading in values to R0,R1 and running an SIMD operation
You can see the results directly in the registers after the operation has completed.

Enjoy!
